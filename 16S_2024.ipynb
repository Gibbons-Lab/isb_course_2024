    "The Google Colab notebook environment will interpret any command as Python code by default. If we want to run bash commands we will have to prefix them by `!`. So any command you see with a leading `!` is a bash command and if you wanted to run it in your terminal you would omit the `!`. For example, if in the Colab notebook you ran `!wget` you would just run `wget` in your terminal.\n",

However, because we are using Google Colab and there are some caveats to using conda here, we will have to hack around the installation a little bit. But no worries, we provide a setup script below which does all this work for us. üòå\n",

So if your amplified region is 450bp long and you have 2x250bp reads and you trim the last 30 bases of each read, truncating the length to 220bp, the total length of covered sequence is 2x220 = 440 which is shorter than 450bp so there will be no overlap. To solve this issue trim less of the reads or adjust the `--p-min-overlap` parameters to something lower (but not too low).\n",

If your minimum overlap is too small ASVs may be merged randomly. Possible fixes are to increase the `--p-min-overlap` parameter or run the analysis on the forward reads only (in our empirical observations, chimeras are more likely to be introduced in the joined reads). *However, losing between 5-25% of your reads to chimeras is normal and does not require any adjustments.*\n",
